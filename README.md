# Assignment-Picture-Gallery-Application

This project is a picture gallery application that allows users to search for and display relevant pictures based on a category name. The application utilizes JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and API calls to retrieve pictures from Unsplash.com and presents them in a visually appealing grid.

Key Features:
Users can enter a category name in a text input field.
A search button triggers the retrieval of pictures based on the entered category.
The application dynamically updates the UI to display the retrieved pictures in a constant size grid.
Each picture is accompanied by the author's name, a description, and a link to the original picture on Unsplash.com.
The grid is responsive and adjusts its layout to a single column when viewed on mobile devices.
